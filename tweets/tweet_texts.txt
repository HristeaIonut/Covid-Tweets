If  we would not think of abandoning a "human" family member, how can we abandon a pet? US CDC has clearly said, there is no evidence that pets spread Corona. Don't snuggle, lick, share food when in home quarantine yes; but don't leave them on the road. Your pet is your own child
To avoid Corona virus spread, home staying is must. We know, a positive thinking leads to happiness and sound health, so be positive about it. You can utilize this period by doing things of of your interest. #StayPositive_StaySafe by doing meditation regularly. https://t.co/7k0ZstUiLl

SHOCKING.  The USA has 30% of the corona-virus cases in the world.  Yet we never had a National Stay at Home Order.  And to make things worse, trump/republicans want people to go back to work while the #TrumpVirus rages.  Does Trump/republicans want the virus to spread? Why
The #WuhanCoronaVirus coverup proves that #WHO is an untrustworthy lackey of China and President Trump was right to defund it. It also proves I was right to continue calling this scourge the Wuhan Corona Virus, because it was literally engineered there.  https://t.co/MUDQmYwV8Q

20/21 Budget was $4.8tril ($1tril deficit)  The deficit now adds all new money Congress has approved for Corona.   US is expected to have revenues of some $3.6 trillion. I doubt this cause much of this comes from payroll taxes.   So inflation hasn‚Äôt moved since 2008. Nada!

Now we can detect the people, who may be corona infected.  After so many trial it has been launched into the market #FeverDetectionCamera
@saaz3 @AdvoBarryRoux but remember the lockdown was not implemented to finish of the virus but to avoid a spike in infection rate. Corona is going to be there for the next 12 or more months... so what then? 1 year lockdown?
During this Lockdown period, the Security Agents in Nigeria has killed innocent #Biafrans more than Corona Virus. It's very Pathetic. @realDonaldTrump dismantle Nigeria now &amp; save humanity @MaziNnamdiKanu @MBuhari @realDonaldTrump @realFFK @Biafralandtwt_1 @POTUS @Europarl_EN @UN https://t.co/Vl7tqvCYfs

Israel is shutting down COVID-19 Clinics in PALESTINE and THEY ARRESTED THE STAFF. Palestinians don‚Äôt even have the RIGHT TO GET TESTED FOR CORONA DURING A PANDEMIC! I‚Äôm so tired of seeing my peoples BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS CONSTANTLY being violated.
Flights bring 15,000 people a day to UK without screening   INDEFENSIBLE..ZERO COMMON SENSE...the failure even to test passengers arriving from overseas, based on ‚Äúscientific advice‚Äù will prove to be one of key reasons outbreak &amp; deaths so great in UK. https://t.co/sfZSSmRaHJ

Airlifting Italian and French intensive-care patients. Donating ventilators to the UK. Transportation of vital supplies on NATO SALIS Antonov aircraft. Etc. No country's military has done more for coronastricken allies than Germany. Let's give a cheer for the Bundeswehr. https://t.co/4ttJSjLuRo
India is putting up the bravest fight against Corona. But the Congress party is leaving no stone unturned to defame the nation.

Most of you won‚Äôt catch Corona, but a big chunk of us will catch diabetes.  Perhaps as we are at war with this virus, we might also want to go to war with the disease that is impacting far more people than corona ever will.

Rahul Gandhi has warned the government about Corona on 12th Feb, if government had taken action on time the problem of people not able to reach their hometown would not have arised. This shows incompetence of the government. @RahulGandhi

Hats off to BMC 0f Mumbai . They have taken more tests than any other city or even any other state of India Highest number of test that is why highest number of positives who are immediately sent the treatment That is most effective of fighting and defeating corona. Thank you BMC

When Merkel, Trump, Conte &amp; other leaders hold Press Conferences often, answering questions abt Corona, why is Modi not doing it in a crisis? Why send Luv Agarwal?

After this corona crisis is over I wish that @narendramodi and @AmitShah teach Shiv Sena a lesson of their life. Be as brutal as possible . The father son duo have nothing to do with Balasaheb so they deserve no sympathy .
Off-topic here but why is it that the New York Times, not a UK media outlet, has to be the one revealing the 'fiasco' and 'embarrassment' of corona antibody tests - bought by govt but didn't work https://t.co/drL2iVbW5X
